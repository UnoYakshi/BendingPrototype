# BendingPrototype
A showcase for bending powers from [Avatar series](https://google.com/).

The first-iteration plans are:
* implement fire projectiles
  * can be thrown
  * can be blocked or go through by other projectiles depending on the strength
  * has unique/customizable trajectory

* design a combat system similar to Jade Empire's one:
  * allows for combos
  * 

* set-up a character:
  * animations (hits, dashes)
  * hit-trails
